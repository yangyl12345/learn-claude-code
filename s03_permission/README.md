# s03: Permission — Check Permissions Before Execution

[English](README.md) · [中文](README.zh.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

s01 → s02 → `s03` → [s04](../s04_hooks/) → s05 → ... → s16 → s17
> *"Check permissions before executing"* — The permission pipeline decides which operations need approval.
>
> **Harness Layer**: Permission — a gate before tool execution.

## The Problem

s02's Agent has 5 tools. File tools are protected by `safe_path`, but bash is unrestricted. Ask it to "clean up the project," and it might run `rm -rf /`.

Safety can't rely on trusting the model — it needs code: a check before every tool execution.

---

## The Solution

![Permission Overview](images/permission-overview.en.svg)

s02's loop is fully preserved. The only change is inserting `check_permission()` before tool execution — each tool call passes through three gates in a fixed order: hard deny first, then soft ask, and if neither matches, allow.

The three gates correspond to three decisions:

| Gate | Purpose | On Match |
|------|---------|----------|
| 1. Deny List | Permanently forbidden operations (`rm -rf /`, `sudo`) | Denied immediately, not executed |
| 2. Rule Matching | Context-dependent operations (reading/writing outside workspace, `rm` files) | Passed to Gate 3 |
| 3. User Approval | After Gate 2 matches, pauses for user confirmation | User decides allow or deny |

None of the three gates match → execute directly. Most routine operations take this path.

## How It Works

![Permission Pipeline](images/permission-pipeline.en.svg)

**Gate 1**: A hard deny list. Check first; if matched, return a block message. This list uses simple string matching to show where the permission gate sits; it is not a complete security boundary.

```python
DENY_LIST = [
    "rm -rf /", "sudo", "shutdown", "reboot",
    "mkfs", "dd if=", "> /dev/sda",
]

def check_deny_list(command: str) -> str | None:
    for pattern in DENY_LIST:
        if pattern in command:
            return f"Blocked: '{pattern}' is on the deny list"
    return None
```

**Gate 2**: Rule matching — describes "when to ask the user." Each rule specifies a tool and a check condition.

```python
import re

DESTRUCTIVE_COMMAND_WORD = re.compile(
    r"(?i)(?:^|[;&|()\n])\s*(?:rm|del)(?=\s|$|[;&|()])"
)

def contains_destructive_command(command: str) -> bool:
    return bool(DESTRUCTIVE_COMMAND_WORD.search(command))

PERMISSION_RULES = [
    {
        "tools": ["read_file", "write_file", "edit_file"],
        "check": lambda args: not (WORKDIR / args.get("path", "")).resolve().is_relative_to(WORKDIR),
        "message": "Access outside workspace",
    },
    {
        "tools": ["bash"],
        "check": lambda args: contains_destructive_command(args.get("command", "")) or any(
            kw in args.get("command", "") for kw in ["rm ", "> /etc/", "chmod 777"]
        ),
        "message": "Potentially destructive command",
    },
]

def check_rules(tool_name: str, args: dict) -> str | None:
    for rule in PERMISSION_RULES:
        if tool_name in rule["tools"] and rule["check"](args):
            return rule["message"]
    return None
```

**Gate 3**: After a rule matches, pause for user input.

```python
def ask_user(tool_name: str, args: dict, reason: str) -> str:
    print(f"\n⚠  {reason}")
    print(f"   Tool: {tool_name}({args})")
    choice = input("   Allow? [y/N] ").strip().lower()
    return "allow" if choice in ("y", "yes") else "deny"
```

**All three gates chained together**, inserted before tool execution:

```python
def check_permission(block) -> bool:
    # Gate 1: Hard deny
    if block.name == "bash":
        reason = check_deny_list(block.input.get("command", ""))
        if reason:
            print(f"\n⛔ {reason}")
            return False

    # Gate 2 + 3: Rule matching → User approval
    reason = check_rules(block.name, block.input)
    if reason:
        decision = ask_user(block.name, block.input, reason)
        if decision == "deny":
            return False

    return True

# In agent_loop — s02's loop with just one line added:
for block in tool_calls:
    if not check_permission(block):           # ← NEW
        results.append({... "content": "Permission denied."})
        continue
    output = TOOL_HANDLERS[block.name](**block.input)  # s02 original
    results.append(...)
```

## Changes from s02

| Component | Before (s02) | After (s03) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Security model | None (trust the model) | Three-gate permission pipeline |
| New functions | — | check_deny_list, check_rules, ask_user, check_permission |
| Loop | Executes all tools directly | Inserts check_permission() before execution |

---

## Try It

```sh
cd learn-claude-code
go run ./s03_permission
```

Try these prompts:

1. `Create a file called test.txt in the current directory` (should pass through)
2. `Delete the file test.txt` (bash + rm triggers Gate 2)
3. `What files are in the current directory?` (read-only, all pass)
4. `Try to write a file to /etc/something` (writing outside workspace triggers Gate 2)
5. On Windows, `del test.txt` and `DEL test.txt` trigger Gate 2, while `model`, `delimiter`, and `echo del test.txt` do not.

What to watch for: Which operations pass through? Which need your confirmation? Which are denied outright?

---

## What's Next

Permission checks are in place — but every check is hardcoded as `check_permission()` inside the loop. What if you want to add logging before and after each tool execution? What if you want to auto-trigger a git commit after certain operations? Scattering this extension logic throughout the loop makes it bloat.

→ s04 Hooks: Add hooks to the loop. Extension logic hangs on hooks; the loop stays clean.
