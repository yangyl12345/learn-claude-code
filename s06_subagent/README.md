## The Problem

The Agent is fixing a bug. It reads many files to trace the call chain, and every tool call and result stays in the parent's `messages[]`. Once the call chain is understood, most of those intermediate details are no longer needed, but they still occupy context.

---

## The Solution

![Subagent Overview](images/subagent-overview.en.svg)

Calling `task` synchronously runs a nested agent loop with a fresh `messages[]`. When that loop finishes, its final text becomes the tool result in the parent conversation.

This is message isolation, not process or filesystem isolation. Parent and subagent run in the same Python process and share `WORKDIR`, so writes and commands still affect the same workspace. The subagent has the five base tools but no `task`, and its tool calls use the same permission and lifecycle hooks as the parent.

---

## How It Works

**run_subagent** creates the fresh message list, runs the nested loop, and returns the final text:

```python
SUB_TOOLS = list(BASE_TOOLS)  # no task tool

def run_subagent(prompt: str) -> str:
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

    for _ in range(30):
        response = client.messages.create(
            model=MODEL, system=SUB_SYSTEM,
            messages=messages, tools=SUB_TOOLS, max_tokens=8000,
        )
        messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
        tool_calls = [
            block for block in response.content if block.type == "tool_use"
        ]
        if not tool_calls:
            return extract_text(response.content) or "(no summary)"

        results = []
        for block in tool_calls:
            output = execute_tool(block, SUB_HANDLERS)
            results.append({... "content": output})
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": results})

    return "Subagent stopped after 30 turns without a final answer."
```

The main Agent calls it just like any other tool:

```python
TASK_TOOL = {
    "name": "task",
    "description": "Run a subagent with fresh conversation context and return its final text.",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {"prompt": {"type": "string"}},
        "required": ["prompt"],
    },
}

TOOLS = [*BASE_TOOLS, TASK_TOOL]
TOOL_HANDLERS = {**BASE_HANDLERS, "task": run_subagent}
```

The boundary is:

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Conversation | Fresh `messages[]` | Parent history is not copied into the subagent |
| Execution | Same process and `WORKDIR` | Filesystem changes remain visible to both loops |
| Return value | Final text only | Child tool calls and results are not copied into parent messages |
| Delegation depth | No `task` in `SUB_TOOLS` | This lesson permits one delegation level |
| Tool policy | Shared Hooks | Parent and subagent use the same permission checks |

The parent dispatches `task` through the same handler map as its other tools. The subagent uses `SUB_SYSTEM`, `SUB_TOOLS`, and its own local `messages` list.

## Try It

```sh
cd learn-claude-code
go run ./s06_subagent
```

Try these prompts:

1. `Use a subtask to find what testing framework this project uses` (sub-Agent reads files, main Agent receives only the conclusion)
2. `Delegate: read all .go files in internal/ and summarize what each one does`
3. `Use a task to create s06_subagent/example/string_tools.go with a slugify(text: str) function, then verify it from the parent agent`

What to watch for: Do `[Subagent started]` / `[Subagent done]` appear? Do subagent tool calls print as `[sub] ...`? Does the parent continue with only the final text returned by `task`?

---

## What's Next

The Agent can now break tasks apart. But different tasks require different knowledge: editing frontend components needs React conventions, writing SQL needs table schemas. Stuffing all this knowledge into the system prompt would blow up the context.
