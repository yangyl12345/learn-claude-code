# s14: MCP Tools — Discover and Invoke External Tools

[English](README.md) · [中文](README.zh.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

[s04](../s04_hooks/) → `s14` → [s15](../s15_integrated_harness/) → s16 → s17

> **Harness layer**: MCP Tools — connect to services, discover tools, and add them to the agent loop.

---

## The Problem

The base tools in earlier chapters are written directly in `main.go`. We could integrate a documentation system and deployment platform by adding `search_docs`, `deploy_status`, and `trigger_deploy`, but every service would require another set of tool definitions, parameter schemas, and call handlers.

MCP separates those responsibilities. A server provides a tool list and invocation endpoint. The harness connects to it, assigns model-facing names, applies permission checks, and gives the discovered tools to the model.

---

## The Solution

![MCP Architecture](images/mcp-architecture.en.svg)

This chapter starts from s04's five base tools and hooks, then adds three parts:

- `MCPClient` stores the tool definitions and call handlers returned by a server.
- `connect_mcp` connects to one server and obtains its tool list.
- `assemble_tool_pool` combines the base tools with tools from every connected server.

The `docs` and `deploy` servers are in-process stand-ins for `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and a dynamic tool pool. This chapter does not implement a real MCP transport.

---

## How It Works

### 1. The base agent loop stays the same

Before each model call, the harness assembles the current tool pool:

```python
def agent_loop(messages: list):
    while True:
        tools, handlers = assemble_tool_pool()
        response = client.messages.create(
            model=MODEL,
            system=assemble_system_prompt(),
            messages=messages,
            tools=tools,
            max_tokens=8000,
        )
        ...
```

After a new server connects, the next `assemble_tool_pool()` call adds its tools to the model input. Tool results are still appended to messages as `tool_result` blocks.

### 2. MCPClient stores discovery results and call handlers

```python
class MCPClient:
    def register(self, tool_defs, handlers):
        self.tools = list(tool_defs)
        self._handlers = dict(handlers)

    def call_tool(self, tool_name, args):
        handler = self._handlers.get(tool_name)
        if not handler:
            return f"MCP error: unknown tool '{tool_name}'"
        try:
            return str(handler(**args))
        except Exception as error:
            return f"MCP error: {type(error).__name__}: {error}"
```

`register()` represents the discovered tool list. `call_tool()` represents the invocation boundary. Errors return to the model instead of terminating the agent loop.

### 3. connect_mcp only connects and discovers

```python
def connect_mcp(name: str) -> str:
    if name in mcp_clients:
        return f"MCP server '{name}' already connected"
    factory = MOCK_SERVERS.get(name)
    if not factory:
        return f"Unknown server '{name}'"
    server = factory()
    mcp_clients[name] = server
    ...
```

Initially, the model sees the five base tools and `connect_mcp`. After `connect_mcp(name="docs")`, the harness stores the docs client. The next model call also sees:

```text
mcp__docs__search
mcp__docs__get_version
```

### 4. Prefixes separate tools from different servers

Several servers may expose `search` or `status`. The harness uses:

```text
mcp__{server}__{tool}
```

`normalize_mcp_name()` replaces characters outside the model tool-name alphabet with underscores. Tool-pool assembly also checks normalized-name collisions and the 64-character limit:

```python
prefixed = f"mcp__{safe_server}__{safe_tool}"
if prefixed in origins:
    raise ValueError("MCP tool name collision after normalization")
```

As a result, `docs.one/get.version` and `docs_one/get_version` cannot silently map to the same name.

### 5. Tool definitions and handlers enter the pool together

```python
tools.append({
    "name": prefixed,
    "description": tool_def.get("description", ""),
    "input_schema": schema,
})
handlers[prefixed] = (
    lambda *, client=server, tool=raw_name, **kwargs:
    client.call_tool(tool, kwargs)
)
```

The model sees the prefixed name. The handler calls `MCPClient` with the server's original tool name. Default arguments capture the current client and tool so every lambda does not point to the last item in the loop.

### 6. The host decides permissions

An MCP server may provide `readOnlyHint` or `destructiveHint`, but those hints come from the server and are not authorization. This chapter uses a host-side policy:

```python
MCP_HOST_POLICY = {
    ("docs", "search"): "allow",
    ("docs", "get_version"): "allow",
    ("deploy", "status"): "allow",
    ("deploy", "trigger"): "confirm",
}
```

`permission_hook()` looks up this policy using the normalized tool name. An unconfigured external tool requires confirmation by default. A description containing `readOnly` does not make a tool trusted.

### 7. Input errors stay at the tool boundary

The model may omit a required argument or send a field the server does not accept. Both `execute_tool()` and `MCPClient.call_tool()` catch those errors and return an error `tool_result`:

```text
MCP error: TypeError: <lambda>() missing 1 required argument: 'query'
```

The model can correct its arguments on the next turn without terminating the lesson script.

## What Changed from s04

| Component | s04 | s14 |
|---|---|---|
| Base tools | Five fixed tools | Unchanged |
| Tool source | Definitions in `main.go` | Base tools plus discovered MCP tools |
| Tool pool | Fixed `TOOLS` | Built each turn by `assemble_tool_pool()` |
| External tool names | None | `mcp__{server}__{tool}` |
| Permission | Shell and path checks | Adds a host-side MCP policy |
| MCP transport | None | In-process server stand-ins demonstrate the boundary |

This chapter does not carry Task, Background, Cron, Team, or Worktree. They join MCP in the s15 Integrated Harness.

## Try It Out

```sh
cd learn-claude-code
go run ./s14_mcp_plugin
```

Enter:

```text
Connect to the docs server, search for agent hooks, and tell me the current documentation API version.
```

A typical tool trace is:

```text
connect_mcp(name="docs")
mcp__docs__search(query="agent hooks")
mcp__docs__get_version()
```

Then enter:

```text
Connect to the deploy server and check the web service status. Do not trigger a deployment.
```

`status` runs under the host policy. `trigger` requires user confirmation.

---

## What's Next

MCP is still an independent course branch here. s15 Integrated Harness combines the base tools, hooks, skills, context, memory, tasks, background work, cron, teams, and MCP in one runtime.
